    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Using 3D modeling software can be helpful for you no matter what your sector is. You can use it in order to 3D print and manufacture your products, to get a better visualization of your projects, or to make simulations. These 3D tools can totally help you to develop your projects in the medical sector, in architecture, or even in chemistry. It will offer you new possibilities and help you in your daily work. But using a 3D modeling software is not that easy, and you might be wondering how to learn 3D modeling.

        Have you ever thought about online classes to learn 3D modeling, to use 3D printing, and take your manufacturing process to the next level? In this blog post, we made a selection of the best online 3D modeling classes. They will totally help you with your 3D printing projects, but not only! Follow the guide.</p>
    </p>
    <h1>Why you should learn how to use 3D modeling software</h1>
    <h3>Design for 3D printing</h3>
    <p>Implementing the 3D printing technology in your manufacturing process can have a lot of benefits. In order to do so, you will necessarily have to deal with 3D modeling to create your products. This way, you will get a 3D representation of your product, and get a clear and better visualization of the whole project.

        Using 3D modeling software and 3D printing will help you with your production and prototyping process. Designers and engineers can totally use it to iterate their designs and create functional prototypes. Indeed, using the 3D technology, creating iterations of your project will be quite fast and easy. You just have to modify the 3D file to make a new iteration using an online 3D printing service like Sculpteo. Knowing how to use 3D modeling software could really help you to do all of this by yourself and save time and money!
        
        If you are not a 3D modeling expert, there are some 3D software tools available on the market for beginners, you can choose among the best free CAD software. Nevertheless, to use 3D software, even if it is for beginners, you still need to know the basics of 3D modeling! For this, online 3D modeling classes might be the best solution.
        
        3D modeling for a 3D printing project is also very specific, that is why at Sculpteo we launched Sculpteo Studio, a consulting service, with experts able to help you with the design aspect of your project. We will come back to it later in this article.</p>
    <h3>Visualization using 3D CAD software </h3>
    <p>Using 3D modeling can also be useful on some other levels. Indeed, using 3D modeling software could help you bring your projects even further and help you with the rendering and the visualization of your project.

        This aspect can particularly be useful for the medical sector, in order to get a better visualization of the patient’s problem. This way the surgeon can proceed to some simulation in order to see how to help the patient and solve his problem. It saves time, money, and lives.
        
        The visualization aspect can also be an asset for some other sectors like architecture for example. It is a smart way to show your architecture project to the customers, thanks to the great rendering tools of CAD software.</p>
    <h3>Art and game design    </h3>
    <p>Knowing how 3D modeling works can also offer you new opportunities. It is essential for example to work in game design, or to make digital art. 3D software is also more and more present in the film industry, to create outstanding visual effects.

        3D design and 3D printing can both be used to give life to amazing art projects, for example. But for this, you necessarily have to know how to use 3D modeling programs.  As you can see, this 3D technology could bring you new possibilities.</p>
    <h3>Selection of the best online 3D modeling classes</h3>
    <p>Learning how to use 3D software can really be difficult if you never learned it at school. But it is not too late to learn! Let’s see how you could learn how to use 3D modeling software. Here is our selection of the best online 3D modeling classes that you will find online, and that will help you to learn the basics of 3D modeling. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Lynda</h3>
            <p>Lynda is offering training and tutorial via LinkedIn Learning. This platform will help you learn all the 3D modeling techniques you need to succeed with your 3D projects. It will help you get the 3D basics you need with a lot of different CAD software, like 3Ds Max, Solidworks, or even Maya and Revit Architecture. Plus, you will get courses for all the different skill levels!</p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>3Dmotive</h3>
        <p>3Dmotive is more focused on 3D for game development, and on 3D modeling software particularly adapted for this use:  3DS Max, Maya, or ZBrush for example. This website is offering a lot of different courses, to learn 3D modeling, texturing, sculpting, rigging, etc.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Yoobee
        </h3>
        <p>Yoobee offers 3D modeling classes online to help you get a better understanding of Maya, of how to create a model using polygons, how to use UV mapping and textures. How to deal with high and low polygon modeling? What are the hard surface modeling techniques? Yoobee’s lessons will help you with all of this. And after these courses, we will be able to do some animation with Maya, and the interface of this advanced software won’t have any secrets for you.</p></li>
        <li>
            <h3>Udemy
            </h3>
            <p>Udemy is not a platform focused on how to learn 3D software, it is actually more general. Indeed, you can learn programming languages or web design basics thanks to this platform. But among all the courses that you can find on this website, there are some relevant modeling classes that will help you to start your project with software such as Blender or 3Ds Max! You will have the opportunity to get a better understanding of the interface of those CAD tools, but you can also go further and learn to create 3D characters or environments.</p>
